Friday Project 5
Quiz Bowl Update
Overview:
Using your old quiz bowl project, to remove the dictionary values (where your questions and
answers were) and pull questions/answers from the database file.
Instructions:
 Download the file called FridayProj5.db
 Remember this is a database file (hence the .db). A database will have tables that the
data is stored in. It is your job to figure out the names of all tables in the database (I’ve
made this easy by only adding one table to the database).
 After you get the table’s name, then you can extract data from that table
